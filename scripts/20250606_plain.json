The ability adds no mana to your mana pool.\n例如：暗碧族接合工为1/2的生物，它具有异能“{T}：加若干{G}，其数量等同于此生物的力量。”一个效应令它-2/-0，然后起动其异能。该异能将不能产生任何法术力到你的法术力池中。\nExample: Chameleon Colossus is a 4/4 creature with the ability “{2}{G}{G}: This creature gets +X/+X until end of turn, where X is its power.” An effect gives it -6/-0, then its ability is activated. It remains a -2/4 creature.

The player casts Awe Strike, which says “The next time target creature would deal damage this turn, prevent that damage. You gain life equal to the damage prevented this way,” targeting one of the attackers. The damage event starts out as [10 damage is dealt to the defending player]. Awe Strike’s effect is applied, so the damage event becomes [5 damage is dealt to the defending player, the defending player gains 5 life]. That’s processed into its results, so the damage event is now [the defending player loses 5 life, the defending player gains 5 life]. Worship’s effect sees that the damage event would not reduce the player’s life total to less than 1, so Worship’s effect is not applied. Then the damage event occurs.\n例如：防御牌手操控一个生物和崇拜，一个具有“若你操控任何生物，则将使你的总生命减至1以下的伤害，改为减少至1。”的结界。该牌手的总生命为2，且被两个不可被阻挡的5/5生物攻击。该牌手施放一击之威，其叙述“防止目标生物在本回合中下一次将造成的伤害。你获得与以此法所防止的伤害等量的生命”，目标其中一个攻击生物。伤害事件以[对防御牌手造成10点伤害]开始。一击之威的效应生效，伤害事件变成[对防御牌手造成5点伤害，防御牌手获得5点生命]。然后变换成结果，伤害事件变成[防御牌手失去5点生命，防御牌手获得5点生命]。崇拜的效应检查伤害事件未将牌手的总生命减少到1以下，所以它将不会生效。然后伤害事件发生。"}, {"chapter": "1", "id": "121.2a", "content": "121.2a An instruction to draw multiple cards can be modified by replacement effects that refer to the number of cards drawn.

The position of each name sticker will continue to be after the number of words that were before it in the object’s name when it was placed. If there are fewer words in the object’s current name, the word on that sticker is added at the end of its name instead. The position and timestamp order of each name sticker on an object is remembered as the object that sticker is on moves from one public zone to another, and it continues to apply to the new object it becomes in that zone (see rule 123.5). This is an exception to rule 400.7.\n名称贴纸修改的叙述可能因为其他效应和/或永久物的牌面朝下状态发生改变（参见规则708，“牌面朝下的咒语和永久物”）。要确定一个其上有贴纸之物件的名称，首先为其可复制特征值，然后每个名称贴纸和其他改变叙述的效应按时间印记顺序生效。每张名称贴纸仍然保持在贴贴纸时与其前面所数单词数量一致的位置上。如果此物件当前的名称过短，则贴纸上的名称将被添加在名称末尾。一个物件从公开区域移动到另一个公开区域时，物件上每张名称贴纸的位置和时间印记顺序都会被记忆，并继续影响新物件。这是规则400.7的例外情况。\nExample: Fae of Wishes, an adventurer card, is in exile with a name sticker on it adding the word “Mana” after its second word, so its name is “Fae of Mana Wishes.” An effect allows that player to cast Granted, its Adventure, from exile. The name of that spell on the stack is “Granted Mana.” After that card is exiled as the Adventure resolves, the sticker’s position (after the second word) is remembered, so the name of the exiled card is once again “Fae of Mana Wishes.”\n例如：趁愿仙儿（Fae of Wishes）是历险者牌，它被放逐且其上有一张名称贴纸在第二个单词后添加了单词“Mana”，因此其名称为“Fae of Mana Wishes”。某效应允许牌手将其作为历险来施放，而其历险部分原本的名称为心愿得遂（Granted）。当它在堆叠上时，其名称会是“Granted Mana”。而历险结算，它再次被放逐后，贴纸的位置（第二个单词之后）会被记忆，因此被放逐之牌的名称又会变为“Fae of Mana Wishes”。\nExample: A player owns a creature named It That Betrays on the battlefield. Using name stickers, they add the word “Eldrazi” to its name after the third word, such that its new name is “It That Betrays Eldrazi.” Later, that creature becomes a copy of a creature named Seeker of the Way. The name sticker continues to apply after the third word, so its new name is “Seeker of the Eldrazi Way.”\n例如：某牌手拥有一个名称为背叛恶物（It that Betrays）的生物。该牌手使用名称贴纸在其名称的第三个单词后添加了单词“Eldrazi”，因此其新名称为“It that Betrays Eldrazi”。之后，该生物成为一个名称为灵道探求者（Seeker of the Way）之生物的复制品。名称贴纸继续在第三个单词后生效，其新名称为“Seeker of the Eldrazi Way”。\nExample: A creature with a name sticker on it becomes enchanted by Witness Protection, an Aura that changes the creature’s name to “Legitimate Businessperson.” Since Witness Protection is also a text-changing effect, and it has a later timestamp than the name sticker, the word on that name sticker is not part of the creature’s name. Its name is “Legitimate Businessperson.”\n例如：某其上有名称贴纸的生物被证人保护结附，它是能够将所结附之生物的名称改变为合法市民（Legitimate Businessperson）的灵气）。由于证人保护同样是改变叙述的效应，且其时间印记晚于名称贴纸，名称贴纸上的单词不会是该生物名称的一部分。其名称是“Legitimate Businessperson”。"}, {"chapter": "1", "id": "123.6d", "content": "123.6d Some effects refer to the number of one or more specific letters on a name sticker.

If that spell is countered this way, put it on top of its owner’s library instead of into its owner’s graveyard.”) Don’t just apply effects step by step without thinking in these cases—read the whole text and apply the rules of English to the text.\n咒语或异能的操控者按照叙述的顺序进行动作。替代性效应可能会影响这些动作。在一些情况下，牌上之后部分的叙述可能会影响之前部分的叙述（例如，“消灭目标生物。它不能重生”或“反击目标咒语。如果该咒语被以此法反击，改为将其置于其拥有者的牌库顶而不是拥有者的坟墓场。”）在这些情况下不要不假思索便按照顺序令效应生效，需要阅读整段叙述并对其规则进行中文理解。"}, {"chapter": "6", "id": "608.2d", "content": "608.2d If an effect of a spell or ability offers any choices other than choices already made as part of casting the spell, activating the ability, or otherwise putting the spell or ability on the stack, the player announces these while applying the effect. The player can’t choose an option that’s illegal or impossible, with the exception that having a library with no cards in it doesn’t make drawing a card an impossible action (see rule 121.3). If an effect divides or distributes something, such as damage or counters, as a player chooses among any number of untargeted players and/or objects, the player chooses the amount and division such that each chosen player or object receives at least one of whatever is being divided. (Note that if an effect divides or distributes something, such as damage or counters, as a player chooses among some number of target objects and/or players, the amount and division were determined as the spell or ability was put onto the stack rather than at this time; see rule 601.2d.)\n如果咒语或异能的一个效应令牌手作出选择，且该选择不是作为施放咒语、起动异能、或用其他方式将咒语或异能放进堆叠的一部分而已经作出的选择，则该牌手于这些效应生效时宣告其选择。牌手不能选择不合法或无法作到的选项，但从空的牌库中抓牌除外（参见规则121.3）。如果一个效应令牌手分配某些事物（例如伤害或指示物）给任何数量不指定目标的牌手和/或物件，该牌手须选择数量和分配方式，使得每位被选择的牌手或物件至少获得一个所分配的事物。（注意如果一个效应令牌手分配某些事物（例如伤害或指示物）给某个数量的目标物件和/或牌手，则分配的数量和分配方式在该咒语或异能放进堆叠的时候就被确定，而非在结算时；参见规则601.2d。）\nExample: A spell’s instruction reads, “You may sacrifice a creature. If you don’t, you lose 4 life.” A player who controls no creatures can’t choose the sacrifice option.\n例如：一个咒语的叙述为“你可以牺牲一个生物。如果你不如此作，你失去4点生命。”一位不操控任何生物的牌手不能选择牺牲生物。"}, {"chapter": "6", "id": "608.2e", "content": "608.2e Some spells and abilities have multiple steps or actions, denoted by separate sentences or clauses, that involve multiple players.

Then the choices for the second action are made in APNAP order, and then that action is processed simultaneously, and so on. See rule 101.4.\n一些咒语和异能具有影响多位牌手的多个步骤或动作，用单独的句子或条款表示。在这些情况下，按照“主动牌手先决定”的顺序为第一个动作作出的选择，然后第一个动作同时进行。然后按照“主动牌手先决定”的顺序为第二个动作作出选择，然后第二个动作同时进行，以此类推。参见规则101.4。"}, {"chapter": "6", "id": "608.2f", "content": "608.2f Some spells and abilities include actions taken on multiple players and/or objects. In most cases, each such action is processed simultaneously. If the action can’t be processed simultaneously, it’s instead processed considering each affected player or object individually. APNAP order is used to make the primary determination of the order of those actions. Secondarily, if the action is to be taken on both a player and an object they control or on multiple objects controlled by the same player, the player who controls the resolving spell or ability chooses the relative order of those actions.\n一些咒语和异能包含对多个牌手和/或物件执行的动作。在大多数情况下，此类动作被同时处理。如果该动作不能被同时处理，则在处理时改为看作其对每个受影响的物件或牌手各自考虑。使用“主动牌手先决定”顺序作为决定这些动作执行顺序的主要依据。其次，如果该动作将同时对一位牌手和其操控的物件、或对多个由同一牌手操控的物件执行，操控正在结算的咒语或异能的牌手来选择这些动作的相对顺序。\nExample: Blatant Thievery says “For each opponent, gain control of target permanent that player controls.” As Blatant Thievery resolves, its controller gains control of all permanents chosen as targets simultaneously.\n例如：公然剽窃叙述为“为每位对手各进行以下流程～获得目标由该牌手操控之永久物的操控权。”于公然剽窃结算时，其操控者同时获得所有被选为目标的永久物的操控权。\nExample: Soulfire Eruption says, in part, “Choose any number of target creatures, planeswalkers, and/or players. For each of them, exile the top card of your library, then Soulfire Eruption deals damage equal to that card’s mana value to that permanent or player.” A player casts Soulfire Eruption targeting an opponent and a creature that opponent controls. As Soulfire Eruption resolves, the player can’t exile the top card of their library multiple times at the same time, so they first choose which target they are considering, then they exile the top card of their library, and finally Soulfire Eruption deals damage to that target. They then repeat this process for the remaining target.\n例如：魂火爆发的部分叙述为“选择任意数量的目标生物，鹏洛客和／或牌手。为他们各进行以下流程～放逐你的牌库顶牌，然后魂火爆发对该永久物或牌手造成伤害，其数量等同于所放逐之牌的法术力值。”牌手以一位对手及一个由该牌手操控的生物为目标施放魂火爆发。于魂火爆发结算时，该牌手不能同时多次放逐其牌库顶牌，因此该牌手先选择其考虑的是哪个目标，然后其放逐其牌库顶牌，最后魂火爆发对该目标造成伤害。然后该牌手为其余的目标重复此流程。"}, {"chapter": "6", "id": "608.2g", "content": "608.2g If an effect gives a player the option to pay mana, they may activate mana abilities before taking that action.

That spell becomes the topmost object on the stack, and the currently resolving spell or ability continues to resolve, which may include casting other spells this way. No other spells can normally be cast and no other abilities can normally be activated during resolution.\n如果一个效应给予牌手支付法术力的选择，他在进行该动作之前可以起动法术力异能。如果一个效应明确指示或允许牌手在结算过程中施放一个咒语，他将该咒语放在堆叠顶端，然后继续按照规则601.2a-h中的步骤施放该咒语，但没有牌手在它被施放之后得到优先权。该咒语成为堆叠最顶端的物件，然后当前正在结算的咒语或异能继续结算，它可能包括以此法施放另一个咒语。一般情况下，在结算过程中没有其他咒语可以被施放且没有其他异能可以被起动。"}, {"chapter": "6", "id": "608.2h", "content": "608.2h If an effect requires information from the game (such as the number of creatures on the battlefield), the answer is determined only once, when the effect is applied.

See rule 113.7a. If an ability states that an object does something, it’s the object as it exists—or as it most recently existed—that does it, not the ability.\n如果一个效应需要游戏信息（例如战场上生物的数量），答案只在该效应生效时决定一次。如果该效应需要一个特定物件的信息，包括该异能自身的来源，如果该物件依然在它应在的公开区域，则该效应使用其当前信息；如果该物件已经不在该区域或该效应将该物件从公开区域移动到隐藏区域，则该效应使用其最后已知信息。参见规则113.7a。如果一个异能的叙述为该物件作出动作，则是该存在的或最后存在的物件进行该动作，而不是异能本身。"}, {"chapter": "6", "id": "608.2i", "content": "608.2i Some effects look back in time and require information about previous game states and actions rather than considering the current game state.
